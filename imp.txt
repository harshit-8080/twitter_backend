Question 1 => What is the lean() method in Mongoose?

Answer   =>
            1.   When you document queried, They are returned as Mongoose Objects.
            2.   With lean() method, the documents are returned as plain objects.
            3.   But now we can't use save, getters and setters methods with plain objects.
            4.   const persons = await Person.find().lean();

Question 2 => limit() and skip() methods in Mongoose.

Answer   =>
            1.   const responses = await Twee.find().skip(2).limit(10);
            2.   skip() used to skip some records and limit() limits the number of records
            3.   limit is like limit in sequelize. and skip is like offset in sequelize.

virtuals
Virtuals are document properties that you can get and set but that do not get persisted to MongoDB. 
The getters are useful for formatting or combining fields, 
while setters are useful for de-composing a single value into multiple values for storage.
