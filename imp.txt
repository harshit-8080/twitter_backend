Question => What is the lean() method in Mongoose?

Answer   =>
            1.   When you document queried, They are returned as Mongoose Objects.
            2.   With lean() method, the documents are returned as plain objects.
            3.   But now we can't use save, getters and setters methods with plain objects.
            4.   const persons = await Person.find().lean();
