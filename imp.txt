Question 1 => What is the lean() method in Mongoose?

Answer   =>
            1.   When you document queried, They are returned as Mongoose Objects.
            2.   With lean() method, the documents are returned as plain objects.
            3.   But now we can't use save, getters and setters methods with plain objects.
            4.   const persons = await Person.find().lean();

Answer   =>
            1.   const responses = await Twee.find().skip(2).limit(10);
            2.   skip() used to skip some records and limit() limits the number of records
            3.   limit is like limit in sequelize. and skip is like offset in sequelize.
